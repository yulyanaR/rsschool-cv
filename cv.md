### About me

I’ve been working as a Quality Assurance engineer for over 3,5 years so far. As the next step in my career, I'm keen on gaining knowledge in FE development.\
\
Having worked for a digital agency and a product-focused company I have experience working on short-term, long-term
projects and products.\
\
Throughout my career, I’m involved in the testing of web applications and their APIs, I’ve been exposed to test automation on Cypress.\
\
I work with developers, project managers and product owners, design and UX teams. I'm involved in sprint planning meetings, daily stand-ups, task kick-off and sign-off meetings, tech refinement and bug triage meetings, design documentation reviews and retrospective meetings.\
\
I also took part in the open-source project ([Mattermost](https://github.com/yulyanaR)).

### Code example
Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.\
The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.\
It should look like this:\
Sam Harris => S.H\
patrick feeney => P.F
```
function abbrevName(name) {
    return name.split(" ").map((n, i, a) =>
        i === 0 || i + 1 === a.length ? n[0] : null).join(".").toUpperCase();
}
```
